# Unix-Chat-Room

## Description
- Note: This project is unfinished, and may or may not ever be completed. It is only made public in a concerted effort to document the work I undertake.
- This a command line chatroom/filesharing program.
- The basic chat functionality is facilitated through Unix UDP sockets, I had intented on facilitating the file sharing through TCP.
- The file sharing aspect of this chatroom is left uncompleted, some of my intended future implementation for it is completed in other projects I have posted to this github. Such as my threadpool and threadsafe queue implementation in my [HTTP-Web-Server](https://github.com/IsaacLatta/HTTP-Web-Server) repository.
